# F1 AeroMetrics: ATR Impact on The Competitiveness 
## Project Overview
This projects aims to investigate the relationship between Formula 1 competitiveness and the Aerodynamic Testing Regulations(ATR), implemented since the 2021 season. The ATR system which limits the wind tunnel time on sliding scale inverse to the Constructors Championship ranking, was introduced to increase the overall quality of the competition by narrowing down the gap between the team performances. By analyzing year-over-year lap time delta and the constructors' championship point gap among different years we aim to prove that the 2021 update on the regulations increases the competitiveness of the sport. The hypothesis will be: The ATR(Aerodynamic Testing Regulations) works as intended. Teams with greater wind-tunnel time improves at a faster rate.
## Motivation
As a passionate follower of the Formula 1 World Championship, I always wanted a more competitive sport since most of the time the results can be gussed by the middle of the season. FIA(Federation Internationale de l'Automobile) tries new regulations so i wanted to see if it has a impact or not. In this study i aim to improve my data analaysis skills through modeling, visualization and analysis.

## Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis 1 (H₀₁): The Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) and Cost Cap regulations do not have a statistically significant impact on the teams' qualifying lap times in terms of gap to the leader.

Alternative Hypothesis 1 (H₁₁): The Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) and Cost Cap regulations have a statistically significant impact on the teams' qualifying lap time in terms of gap to the leader.

Null Hypothesis 2 ($H_{02}$): There is no significant correlation between the wind-tunnel time (ATR Limits) and the rate of in-season lap time improvement.

Alternative Hypothesis 2 ($H_{12}$):There is a significant correlation between the wind-tunnel time (ATR Limits) and the rate of in-season lap time improvement.

## Data Sources
Race and Qualifying Lap Times Data: For every race and qualifying session the data of the aravage pace and fastest lap for both drivers of every team is recorded: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data

ATR times per team decided by the FIA starting from the 2021 season: Motorsport Technical Reports / FIA Docs
